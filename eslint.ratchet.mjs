// eslint.ratchet.mjs — GENERATED. Do not hand-edit to make a build green.

//
// THE RATCHET ONLY SHRINKS.
//
// Every entry below is a rule that a file violates TODAY, turned off for that
// file alone so `npm run lint` passes with zero source changes. It is a debt
// register, not a permission slip.
//
//   * A refactor wave DELETES the entries it fixed and re-runs `npm run lint`.
//     If the file is clean the deletion sticks; if it is not, lint says so.
//   * ADDING an entry — a new file, or a new rule on an existing file — is the
//     INTEGRATOR's call. Never an executor's, and never the way to land code
//     that does not pass.
//   * Regenerating wholesale (`npm run lint:ratchet`) after writing new code
//     silently widens the ratchet and defeats the entire design. Regenerate only
//     to seed it, or to re-baseline after a deliberate rule-set change.
//   * `EQ_LINT_NO_RATCHET=1 npx eslint .` shows the true, un-suppressed state.
//   * The worklist for the refactor waves is lint-worklist.md, generated beside
//     this file from the same run.
//
// Baseline: 0 files, 0 file×rule entries, 0 suppressed violations.
// Generated 2026-08-03 by scripts/lint-report.mts.
// The trailing `// N` on each line is that file's violation count for that rule
// at generation time — a size hint for whoever picks the file up, nothing more.
