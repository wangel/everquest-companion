// THE TYPED-/loc MARKER (JOS-98) — the parser, the transform, and where the marker is remembered.
//
// TWO THINGS HERE ARE SILENTLY WRONG RATHER THAN LOUDLY BROKEN, and both get a golden:
//
//   * THE ORDER. /loc prints NORTH/SOUTH FIRST, then west/east, then elevation. Read it as x-first
//     and every marker lands mirrored about the diagonal — which, on a map you have never walked,
//     looks exactly like a marker.
//   * THE SIGNS. EQ's world grows WEST and NORTH; the map file grows EAST and SOUTH. Get one of the
//     two negations wrong and the marker is in the wrong half of the zone, still plausibly on a
//     path, still drawn in the right colour. This repo has already shipped that class of bug once
//     (JOS-65, "North for South"), so the transform is not asserted against its own arithmetic —
//     it is asserted against A LANDMARK, below.
//
// THE LANDMARK, AND WHY IT IS EVIDENCE RATHER THAN A RESTATEMENT. Two INDEPENDENT authorities in
// this repo describe the same NPCs in Oasis of Marr, in different coordinate spaces, neither
// derived from the other:
//
//   * the WIKI BESTIARY (`mobs.json`, scraped from eqlwiki page `|location` fields) states Transan
//     at /loc (613, 51) and Isslana at /loc (512, 71) — /loc order, as a player would read them;
//   * BREWALL'S HAND-DRAWN MAP of the same zone labels `Transan_(Weapons)` at map (-51, -613) and
//     `Isslana_(Merchant)` at map (-71, -512) — map-file order, verbatim bytes off a live install.
//
// Run the wiki's readings through the parser and `mapFromLoc` and they land on the map file's own
// labels TO THE UNIT, both signs pinned at once (positive ns → negative y, positive ew → negative
// x). A wrong order or a flipped sign misses by more than a thousand map units. Nothing in this
// chain is the transform quoting itself: a wiki scraper and a fan cartographer agreeing is the
// closest thing to ground truth this feature can have.
//
// Then the SCREEN, through the real parser and the real projection, because a correct map
// coordinate rendered upside down is still a marker in the wrong place (the JOS-65 lesson exactly).
//
// Arithmetic, strings and a fake store — no React, no DOM, no fixture — so this suite NEVER skips.
