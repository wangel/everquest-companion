// JOS-251 — THE CHARM ROSTER, DERIVED. And the audit that says it is the right one.
//
// THE CLAIM UNDER TEST: given the effect lines JOS-251 taught the scrape to capture, "which spells
// charm?" is a QUERY over committed data rather than a regex somebody maintained by hand — and the
// answer it returns is exactly the roster JOS-250's charm-roster research assembled by reading the
// wiki page by page, including every gap and every false positive that research found.
//
// THE ORACLE IS THAT RESEARCH (JOS-250 comment, 2026-08-12), and it is written out below as a
// literal list of names, because the whole value of this test is that the two were produced
// INDEPENDENTLY: one by a human reading spell pages, one by a rule anchored at the head of a
// sentence. A roster that agrees with a hand audit it never saw is a roster that can be trusted to
// notice the next spell nobody thought about.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE PINS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. The parser swap itself landed on top of JOS-250:
// `ParserConfig.charmSpell` is now the derived set with `CHARM_STEMS` as the fallback for a name
// the catalog does not carry, and tests/charmCcRoster.test.mts asserts the two agree on every row.
// This file is the layer underneath — the grammar, the class memberships, the delta against the
// hand audit, and the separation. `ccSpell` deliberately did NOT move; R3b/R3c pin the derivation's
// answer for the nineteen spells the two disagree about, so the owner ruling that decides them has
// something to land against. The argument is in src/main/log/rulesets.ts under THE HALF-SWAP.
//
// SEPARABILITY IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED (the owner's second constraint). R7 builds the roster from
// the RAW committed JSON with no correction overlay applied at all, and then proves the corrected
// entries produce the IDENTICAL roster — so the derivation layer is not load-bearing for the data,
// and the data is not load-bearing for the derivation. Delete src/main/data/spellEffectClass.ts and
// spells.json is still a complete, valid scrape.
//
// Run: `npm test`.
