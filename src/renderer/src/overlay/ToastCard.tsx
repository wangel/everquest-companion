// ToastCard — one celebration card, and the compact item window it embeds.
//
// MUI-FREE BY LAW (AGENTS.md: the overlay bundle is plain React + inline styles). This file is
// deliberately not the lazily-imported `ItemWindow` the event overlay's hover cards use: a
// toast's reward block is three lines and an icon, it arrives PRE-FORMATTED in the payload
// (docs/plans/celebration-toasts.md T5 — the overlay fetches nothing), and pulling MUI into the
// window that is supposed to be the cheapest thing on screen would defeat the point.
//
// LOOK (§4): dark glass, a gold title, a muted subtitle, a 10px radius and a hairline. Enter is
// a 250 ms slide-down + fade; exit is the same in reverse over 300 ms. Both are CSS transitions
// on transform/opacity — compositor-only properties, so the animation costs the game nothing.
//
// SCALE (owner, 2026-08-05: "look and feel is good, but it needs to be a bit bigger/more
// prominent"). Every number below went up by roughly a quarter — 18px title, 13px subtitle,
// 52px icon, more padding — against a 560px lane (main/overlayLayout.ts). The MOTION is
// deliberately untouched: it was already right, and a celebration that arrives faster or
// further would read as an alarm.
//
// THE ITEM CARD IS THE CLICK TARGET (T6) where there is one: it takes the pointer cursor and a
// hairline highlight on hover. The card as a whole pins on hover; only the reward block claims to
// go anywhere.
//
// …AND WHERE THERE IS NO REWARD BLOCK, THE CARD SAYS SO IN WORDS (JOS-334). The level-up card is
// the whole click target — a level is not a reward you can hold — and it spent its first release
// advertising that with a pointer cursor and nothing else, which is an affordance only for a
// reader who was already hovering a card they had no reason to hover. It now prints a compact
// action naming where the click goes ("See what's new at 24"). The card-wide click is untouched:
// the button fires the SAME `onOpen`, so this is the promise becoming visible, not a second path.
//
// EVERY CARD SAYS WHOSE IT IS, AND EVERY CARD CLOSES (JOS-83). A new user reported the strip as a
// nameless rectangle they took for a malfunction, so the card grew a chrome row: the app's name on
// the left, a × on the right. The row is INSIDE the card, which is the only thing this overlay
// ever paints — the resting state is still an empty transparent window, and that is what keeps
// the kind defaultable-on. The × dismisses THIS card (the queue reducer has always had the
// action; nothing was wired to it), and on the introduction card there is one more way out: a
// button that closes the overlay for good.
