// mobPins.ts — the PURE half of the Maps tab's right-hand pane: what is in this zone, and where.
//
// The pane answers one question with TWO authorities that have never been shown side by side
// before, and the whole point of this module is that it never lets them blur into one:
//
//   1. THE WIKI'S BESTIARY — the committed mob catalog (`data/eqlegends/mobs.json`), joined to
//      the zone on screen by `mobsInZone` (features/mobs/mobZone.ts, Task #64). That join is
//      REUSED verbatim, not re-implemented: the Mobs tab already answers "what lives where I
//      am", and two folds that could disagree about a zone would be an invisible bug.
//   2. THE MAP FILE'S OWN LABELS — `MapData.points`, already extracted by the main-side parser
//      (src/main/maps/parseMap.ts). Nothing here re-parses anything; the renderer receives the
//      points and this module shapes them into rows.
//
// COORDINATES ARE REAL OR THEY ARE ABSENT (world-model law 1). A mob is PINNED only when its
// wiki page stated numbers under `|location`; a mob whose page says "Various" or "?" is still
// listed — it lives here, that is a fact — with no pin and nothing that looks like one. There
// is no interpolation, no zone-centre fallback, no "probably near the entrance".
//
// MEASURED, 2026-08-04 (all 7,866 catalog pages re-read from eqlwiki.com): 6,283 state at least
// one usable coordinate — 8,990 spawn points in total, since a page may state several
// (`50% @ (a, b), 50% @ (c, d)`). So roughly FOUR IN FIVE named mobs are locatable and one in
// five is not, and the pane says which is which per row rather than in a footnote.
//
// THE CONVERSION IS `mapFromLoc` AND NOTHING ELSE. mapGeometry.ts has owned the `/loc` → map
// transform since wave 1 (`mapX = -ew, mapY = -ns, mapZ = elevation`, documented from Yther
// Ore's worked example). This wave measured it against real data for the first time: of six
// candidate transforms over 7,423 stated coordinates in the 119 mapped zones, that one puts
// 99.4% of them inside the zone's own extent (next best 66.4%) and a median 14.8 map units from
// the nearest wall segment (next best 170.8). It was right; now it is evidence.
//
// WHY ELEVATION DOES NOT SLICE. Only ~2% of pages state a third number, so filtering pins by the
// active floor band would hide 98% of them on a floor-sliced map for want of data the wiki does
// not have. Pins are carried with `z` when stated and drawn regardless — a pin you can see on
// the wrong floor is a smaller lie than a mob the pane silently deleted.
