// WHERE YOU SAID YOU ARE — the typed `/loc` marker: parsing it, remembering it, and forgetting it
// on request. Pure: no React, no DOM beyond a `getItem/setItem` pair it is HANDED, so every rule
// here is node-testable (tests/mapLocMarker.test.mts), exactly like zoneFollow.ts beside it.
//
// THE ASK (JOS-98, a v0.10.0 report): "Would also be nice if there was a marker on the map for my
// current positon. I realize I would need to feed the map a /loc but would gladly do so."
//
// WHY THE USER HAS TO TYPE IT AT ALL. The log states the zone you entered and nothing else
// positional — `Your Location` appears ZERO times in it, re-measured for this ticket across the
// owner's whole 116.8 MB `eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt` and every other log in that directory,
// because /loc answers in the game window and is never written to the file the app tails. So there
// is no live tracking to build and none is pretended: the app knows one position, the one you
// handed it, and it says so rather than implying a dot that follows you. That absence is also why
// the reporter offered to feed it in by hand — they had already worked out that nothing else could.
//
// THE SHAPE IS EVIDENCED, NOT INVENTED. Since the log never carries the line, the exact wording was
// taken from players pasting their own /loc output into wiki walkthroughs (24 pages in
// `scripts/sources/cache/quests/`), e.g. page-15280: `Your Location is -192.19, -129.81, 3.26`. So:
// the literal words `Your Location is`, then three signed decimals at two places, comma-and-space
// separated, no parentheses, no trailing period of the game's own. Everything this parser accepts
// BEYOND that shape is defensive slack, never a second believed format.
//
// THE TRANSFORM IS NOT REDERIVED HERE. `mapGeometry.mapFromLoc` has owned `/loc` → map-file
// coordinates since wave 1 (`mapX = -ew, mapY = -ns, mapZ = elevation`), it is the transform
// `mobPins.ts` measured against 7,423 wiki-stated coordinates across 119 mapped zones (99.4%
// inside their own zone's extent, median 14.8 map units from the nearest wall), and JOS-65 settled
// which way the RESULT points. This module's whole job on that axis is to produce a well-formed
// `EqLoc` and hand it over. A second copy of those two negations is a second thing to get wrong.
//
// PARSE FORGIVINGLY, REJECT HONESTLY. A paste is a paste: it may carry the log's timestamp, the
// game's own sentence, commas or plain spaces, a `+`, any amount of surrounding whitespace. All of
// that is stripped. What is NOT done is guessing — a line with a word in the middle of the numbers,
// or two numbers where three were meant, produces a stated refusal and NO marker. A marker in
// roughly the right place is the one outcome worse than no marker at all (world-model law 1).
//
// /loc PRINTS Y, X, Z — north/south FIRST. That is the trap this module exists to hold still: the
// first number the game prints is the north/south reading, not an x. `EqLoc` names its fields
// `ns`/`ew` for that reason and nothing here ever calls them x and y.
