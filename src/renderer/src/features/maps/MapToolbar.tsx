// The map viewer's CONTROLS: the zone selector, zoom / fit, the layer toggles, the per-layer
// pack choice.
//
// THE ZONE SELECTOR AND THE MODE ARE THE ONLY CONTROLS THAT RENDER WITH NO MAP ON SCREEN, and
// they render FIRST. Everything else here describes the drawing — which layers, which floor,
// which pack — and a control that states a fact about nothing is worse than an absent one. Those
// two are the opposite case: they are how you get a map at all, how you leave the one you have
// (MapZoneSelect.tsx carries why that has to be permanent), and which of you and the log chose
// what is on screen (JOS-97 — see ZoneModeControls).
//
// STATE, NEVER PROCESS (AGENTS.md UI conventions). Every control here states a fact — which
// layers are drawn, which pack each half came from, which zone is open. Nothing narrates.
//
// …AND NOTHING HERE MOVES WHEN THE MAP ARRIVES (JOS-205). This is a WRAPPING row above the content
// area, so every control that appears with the map used to push the map down and shrink it. The
// row now holds the space its drawing controls will need while the map is in flight — see
// `DrawnRow` at the bottom, which carries the measurement.
//
// AND NOTHING ON THIS ROW MOUNTS A POPPER (JOS-143). It is a WRAPPING row of controls, three of
// which are dropdowns — the zone combobox and the two pack selects — and every popper on it was a
// hit target sitting in the space where a neighbour's option list opens. The zone-mode chip is the
// clearest case: it sits immediately right of the zone selector, so its card and that selector's
// dropdown claim the same rectangle, and MUI tooltips take pointer events. Hover text that is
// load-bearing survives as a native `title`: not in the DOM, no hit area, cannot eat a click. The
// icon-only buttons keep an `aria-label` too, because a title is decoration and a name is not.
//
// THE ONE BOX THAT IS NOT A CONTROL OVER THE MAP FILE is the `/loc` field (JOS-98,
// MapLocField.tsx): it states, and lets you set, the single position the app has been TOLD. It
// earns its place on a row about the drawing because that is exactly what it is — the marker is
// drawn on the surface. It is no longer the ONLY way one gets there (the game logs `/loc` after
// all — MapLocField.tsx's header carries that story), but it is still the only way to mark
// somewhere you are NOT. Gated on `hasMap` with the rest: a coordinate typed against no map has
// nowhere to land.
//
// NOTHING HERE SEARCHES. The bar used to carry a `Search labels…` box, a This zone / All zones
// scope toggle and a sidebar toggle called `Zone` — three controls asking the same question the
// sidebar's one box now answers, in a hit list that lived somewhere else entirely (MapMobPane.tsx
// carries the merge). What is left describes the DRAWING, which is the only thing this row was
// ever coherent about.
//
// WHY THE PACK CHOICE IS PER LAYER, and why `Auto` is the default: MEASURED (§1a) — the game's
// own map set holds 285 label points across 58 files while the shipped Brewall pack holds 26,607
// across 562. Geometry wants the EQL-authored default set; labels are a Brewall-pack feature.
// `Auto` is that resolution order, and it is what makes the search box non-empty on a stock
// install. Naming a pack here only overrides the order, never the merge.
//
// THE LEGEND LAYER IS OFF BY DEFAULT and that is not cosmetic: `_2` files draw a colour key at
// fixed off-map coordinates (measured, `brewall\airplane_2.txt`: y ∈ [-250, 4800] against a map
// of y ∈ [-1668, 1737]). It is excluded from the bounds by the parser, so switching it on shows
// it sitting outside the zone rather than shrinking the zone to a speck.

 * THE DRAWING CONTROLS, AND THE SPACE THEY TAKE UP BEFORE THEY EXIST (JOS-205).

 * MEASURED, on the owner's report that the map "bounces around" on load: this bar is 40 px tall
 * with only the zone selector on it and 88 px once a map arrives and eight more controls wrap it
 * onto a second line — so the map pane below started 48 px lower and 48 px shorter than it had
 * been a frame earlier, and everything on screen moved. The map is not what changed size; its
 * CHROME is.
 *
 * So the row is held while the map is in flight, by rendering the very controls that will fill it
 * with `visibility:hidden`. Nothing else can be as exact: the height of a wrapping row is a
 * function of its contents and the window's width, and no reserved constant can know either. A
 * `display:contents` wrapper keeps them DOM SIBLINGS of the selector — `Stack useFlexGap` spaces
 * its flex items, and a real box here would collapse eight controls into one unwrappable unit and
 * change the very number this exists to keep constant. `visibility` is inherited, so the one
 * declaration reaches every control; hidden controls are out of the tab order and take no hover.
 *
 * It reserves whenever a map could still be drawn (`reserve`, decided by the view). The one state
 * that does not is the machine with no map packs at all: nothing can ever draw there, so a held
 * row would be claiming otherwise. Everything else — the fetch in flight, the frame before the
