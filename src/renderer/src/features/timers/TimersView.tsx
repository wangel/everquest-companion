// THE TIMERS TAB — respawn clocks started by death messages (JOS-194).
//
// Two panels, and the second one is why the feature is usable on the first kill of a fresh
// install rather than after a configuration session:
//
//   LEFT   the live clocks. One row per watched mob that has died, counting down — and, since
//          round 7, carrying everything that mob's watch can be edited with.
//   RIGHT  what you just killed. Every mob whose death this fold has seen recently, each with a
//          one-click Watch. Clicking it does not merely arm the FUTURE — the module already holds
//          the death, so the clock starts from the kill you already made. That is the whole
//          discoverability story: kill something, look at this tab, click Watch, see a clock.
//
// NOTHING IS CLOCKED UNTIL YOU SAY SO (owner ruling, 2026-08-10 — argued in shared/respawn.ts).
// The right-hand panel is therefore the ONLY way a row ever appears on the left, which makes the
// two panels a single flow rather than a list and its settings: the empty state on the left points
// at the panel on the right, and the panel on the right is a list of things that have actually
// died rather than a catalog to go shopping in.
//
// AND THE PAGE IS SCOPED TO ONE ZONE (same ruling). The scope switch at the top defaults to the
// zone the fold is in and the whole page obeys it — clocks AND recently-killed — because "what can
// I do about this right now" is a question about where you are standing. All zones is one click
// away and is what you want when you are setting up a camp you are not in yet; the counts on the
// switch say how much is hiding either way, so the default never silently swallows anything.
//
// AND UNWATCHING IS ON THE MOB, NOT IN A LIST (owner ruling, round 4, FINISHED in round 7). Watch
// was always a per-mob click; stopping used to mean finding the name again in "Your watches" at the
// bottom of this page. Round 4 put Unwatch on the clock row and on the Recently-killed entry and
// left the list standing for the one thing it still had — typing a number. Round 7 removed it: the
// seconds box is on the mob's Running entry now, beside the gaps that produced the number it
// overrides, and this page has no third section. The stated cost is in shared/respawn.ts: a watch
// whose clock is not on screen (another zone — switch the scope; or a mob you have never killed) has
// no row to carry its box, and its Recently-killed entry still toggles the watch off.
//
// AND A WATCHED MOB IS ALWAYS UNDER RUNNING (owner ruling, round 8). The owner clicked Watch on a
// kill from hours earlier, the button flipped to Unwatch — and this panel still read "No clocks
// running", because the fold swept every row whose estimate had elapsed more than half an hour ago.
// A watched mob the fold holds a death for now ALWAYS has a row here; when its clock is long gone it
// says so honestly (`respawnClockLabel`) and sorts under the live ones. So the empty state below
// means what it says again — nothing is watched here, rather than something watched and hidden.
//
// AND THIS PAGE RE-ORDERS AGAINST ITS OWN CLOCK, the way the floating window always has. The order
// is a function of NOW — soonest due, a sighting ageing out of UP, a countdown passing into stale —
// while the module publishes an order only when the FOLD changes, which on an idle log is never.
// So the rows are sorted here, per tick, by the same `orderRespawnRows` both surfaces read.
//
// AND THE PAGE STOPPED EXPLAINING ITSELF (owner ruling, round 5). Each of the four rounds above
// left its ruling written out in prose at the top of this file's render, and the result was a
// thirteen-line paragraph over a page whose every control is one word. It is gone, not moved: the
// facts it recited are each already stated by something the user is looking at — the rung on a
// clock row, `wiki default`, `UP`, the zone chip and the scope switch, the Watch/Unwatch pair —
// and the sentences behind them live on those things' hovers (`respawnProvenance`,
// `RESPAWN_CONFIRM_TITLE`, both in shared/respawn.ts). Round 7's addendum took one more: Unwatch has
// no tooltip at all now — the control speaks for itself. And round 9 took the LAST one: the caption
// under the clocks existed to state the seconds box's limits, the box is gone, and the modal that
// replaced it says what it accepts where the typing happens. This page now carries no standing
// sentence of its own at all.
//
// AND THE NUMBER IS EDITED IN A MODAL (owner ruling, round 9). The clock row's duration and its rung
// are one bordered unit with a small edit affordance attached; pressing it opens `RespawnEditDialog`,
// which is the first surface in this feature with room to put the evidence and the decision in front
// of each other — the hover card, every gap the fold measured, the wiki's words and a link to the
// page they came from, the number, and the way back to the calculated one. It is TAB-ONLY: the
// floating window paints the overridden STATE and carries none of the editing.
//
// AND EVERY MOB ON THIS PAGE OPENS ITS CARD (owner ruling, rounds 6 and 7). Pointing at a clock row
// reveals the mob's drop table with your own loot counts riding it; round 7 put the same card on the
// Recently-killed entries, which is the surface where "is this worth watching at all" is actually
// asked. One component, one lookup door, two notes (`respawnCardNote` / `respawnCandidateNote`).
//
// AND RECENTLY KILLED IS SEARCHABLE (owner ruling, round 7), built to the JOS-206 findings rather
// than to taste, because this is the same shape of list that made the Sky tab stall:
//
//   * THE FILTER IS PURE AND SINGLE-PASS, and lives in shared/respawn.ts where it is node-tested.
//   * THE INPUT OWNS ITS OWN STATE and is memoized, so a keystroke never waits on the list.
//   * THE QUERY LIVES IN THE PANEL THAT USES IT, not on the page — typing re-renders the
//     Recently-killed column and nothing else. The clocks column, which re-renders once a second on
//     its own, is not dragged into it.
//   * THE ROW IS MEMOIZED AND ITS PROPS ARE STABLE — it takes the mob's KEY and hands it back, so
//     the two writers are `useCallback`s with no per-row closure and no `prefs` in their deps (the
//     prefs are read through a ref at click time, which is the only moment they are needed).
