// DropperCell — the kill target for one Plane of Sky quest item ("for our sky tracker, we should
// also show the kill target for each item per eql wiki database", owner), and the quest-level
// "Kill: <boss>" caption the collapsed summary row carries.
//
// Its own file so QuestAccordion stays a layout file: this is the ONE place the resolved droppers
// (poskyDroppers.ts) become words, and every surface that names them — the expanded table's
// "Dropped by" column, the collapsed row's chip tooltip, and now the summary row's caption —
// reads it.
//
// ONE LINE, always. Up to DROPPER_DISPLAY_CAP names inline, the rest folded into "+N more"; the
// full roster with level and zone rides a native `title`. Sky quest items really do drop from
// several bosses (every Efreeti weapon is Noble Dojorn AND Overseer of Air AND the Hand of
// Veeshan), so the overflow is the normal case, not an edge one.
//
// NO POPPER (JOS-143). Both surfaces here used to anchor `placement="top"` MUI tooltips, which is
// the direction that lands on the Sky toolbar: the "Kill:" caption sits in the collapsed summary
// row, so for the first quest in the list its card opened straight across the five dropdowns in
// QuestFilterBar and ate their clicks (MUI tooltips are interactive by default — the popper takes
// pointer events). The roster is now a `title` string: an OS tooltip, not in the DOM, no hit area,
// so it cannot block anything. One line per mob becomes one newline-joined string, which is what
// a native title can carry.
//
// Nothing resolved ⇒ fall back to what the scrape literally said (`who`, e.g. "random drop — any
// Plane of Sky mob" on the wind runes, which is the honest answer: there is no kill target).
// Neither ⇒ render nothing at all. Never a guess.
//
// The NAMES ARE THE LINK. A resolved dropper is a catalog row (`DropperMob.entry`), which is
// exactly what MobPage wants, so the tracker deep-links straight to it — same `{ mob, entry }`
// payload MobsView's own search results send, so a name that names several pages still lands on
// the one this item's loot list came from. Keyboard-reachable like MobResultRow (role=button,
// tabIndex, Enter/Space) because a table of names that only a mouse can follow is not a link.
// Names stay RAW (law 2) — no title-casing, no article stripping.
