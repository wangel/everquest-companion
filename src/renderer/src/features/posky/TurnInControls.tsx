// posky/TurnInControls.tsx — the two surfaces that speak about TURN-INS (JOS-131).
//
// A Sky turn-in stopped being a terminal flag and became an event with a count: handing a quest
// in spends the items it required, so the progress bar drops back to what you are holding and
// these two controls are the only things that remember you did it. They live in their own file
// because they are read in two places (the quest row and the Ignored list) and because
// QuestAccordion.tsx was at its measured 400-line ceiling.
//
// NO POPPER (JOS-143). The badge sits in the collapsed summary row and the counter in the expanded
// panel's own toolbar, so both are candidates to open a card over the tab's dropdowns; the whole
// Sky tracker is popper-free now rather than file-by-file, which is the only version of the rule a
// guard can hold. Every sentence below survives verbatim as a native `title` — an OS tooltip that
// is not in the DOM and has no hit area, so it cannot intercept a click.

 * classUnlocks.ts rule, which is also why the two sentences are visibly different claims rather
 * than one wording with a noun swapped.
 *
 * TOTAL over `DerivedEvidence` on purpose: a source added to the ladder is a compile error here
 * until somebody writes the sentence that explains it to a player.

/**
 * THE TURN-IN BADGE: whether you have handed this quest in, and how many times.
 *
 * It renders nothing at zero — an absent badge is how "never turned in" reads, and a chip saying
 * so would be noise on most of the list. The count appears from the second turn-in on
 * (`turnInBadgeLabel`), so the common case stays the plain "Turned in" it has always been.
 * `data-count` states the number a test can read without parsing the label.
 *
 * `evidence` is the DERIVED reading (issue #27, extended by JOS-429) — the count exists because
 * something other than a logged or stated turn-in proves it — and the hover says WHICH thing,
 * because a reader who cannot tell "the log said so" from "we worked it out" cannot tell which rows
 * to trust (classUnlocks.ts).
 *
 * `data-inferred` is unchanged and still means "this count is derived", so every existing test that
 * asks the one-bit question keeps its answer; `data-evidence` is the new attribute that names the
 * rung, for a test that needs to tell the two apart.
