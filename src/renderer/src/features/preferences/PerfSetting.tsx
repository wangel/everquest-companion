// PerfSetting — Preferences → Performance (docs/plans/perf-profiling.md P5).
//
// TWO THINGS, and they are deliberately in one section because they answer one question:
//
//   THE HUD SWITCH — off by default. Turning it on puts a live `CPU 12% · 480 MB` chip in the
//   title bar and starts the 2 s sampler in main; turning it off stops it and removes the chip.
//   Nothing about it is subtle, and nothing about it runs while it is off.
//
//   LAST STARTUP — read-only, and recorded on EVERY launch whether the HUD was on or not. This
//   is the half that answers "why was that reload stuttery" AFTER the fact, from inside the app,
//   which is the whole reason the marks are unconditional (plan P4).
//
// STATE, NEVER PROCESS (the repo's UI law): the captions say what the setting does and what the
// numbers mean. Nothing here explains samplers, probes or IPC — the user asked to see how the
// app is behaving, not how it looks at itself.
//
// ONE BORDER: PreferencesView already wraps each item in an outlined Paper, so this renders bare
// Stacks.

 * hand-testing startup performance is restart → read the new phases → repeat, and the two halves
 * of that loop belong on one card. (The other candidate was the dev-triage nav row, which is
 * where dev tooling lives — but the triage tab is about the feedback backlog, and a restart
 * button parked in it would be a second, unrelated meaning for that surface.)
 *
 * `DEV_TOOLS` folds to a compile-time literal (src/renderer/src/devFlags.ts, anchored on
 * `import.meta.env.DEV`), so in `electron-vite build` its one call site reads `false && …`,
 * rollup deletes the branch and then this now-unreferenced function with it. A COMPONENT rather
 * than a module-level element for exactly that reason (NavDrawer's note): a top-level `jsx()`
 * call is not something rollup can prove side-effect free and would keep the strings alive,
 * while a function nobody calls is plainly dead. MEASURED on `npm run build` output, not
 * assumed: `Restart app`, `restartApp` and `dev:restart` are all absent from `out/renderer`,
 * which is the shape every packaged build and every e2e launch runs.
 *
 * IT HAS A PENDING STATE NOW, and that is not decoration. JOS-61's click killed the process
 * instantly, so there was nothing to show. The watcher route asks somebody else to rebuild and
 * relaunch us, so for a couple of seconds the correct answer is "waiting" — and if the wait
 * outlives `RESTART_STALL_MS`, the honest answer is that nothing restarted and why. The one
 * thing main cannot detect is whether the dev server was started with `--watch` (the flag never
 * reaches this process), so the button reports the silence rather than pretending to know.
 *
 * The chip, not a tooltip, says what this is (the UI conventions' tooltip diet). Nothing
 * confirms: the whole point is that it is one click, and main's handler refuses outright in a
 * packaged build anyway (src/main/devRestart.ts).
