/**
 * The two ALWAYS-MOUNTED celebration watches, so both fire on any tab.
 *
 * Boss kills: useBossKills gates out the historical baseline. This is the SINGLE
 * always-mounted detector, so it's the one place we fire the 'bossDefeat' app signal for
 * the alerts extension. ONE callback carries all three surfaces — snackbar, sound and toast
 * fire on any roster kill CREDITED to you, repeats included, matching the confetti the Boss
 * tab bursts. A boss killed by a stranger in open world is tracked and celebrated by nobody
 * (owner, 2026-08-05); the credit test is the log's own experience line, which is also why a
 * GROUP kill still celebrates — party experience is experience.
 *
 * It used to be two (Task #24): the sound rode a narrower `onNewDefeat` — first kill at a new
 * instance tier — so the app cheered a repeat kill on screen and said nothing. Retired by the
 * owner 2026-08-04: "every time is worth celebrating." The alert's own cooldown is the rate
 * limit now, and fireAppSignal applies it, so even if the Boss tab's own detector fires in
 * the same instant it can't double-play.
 *
 * Sky turn-ins: useProgress seeds a silent baseline on the first hydrated snapshot, so
 * historical completions on load never fire — only a live turn-in transition does
 * (Task #46). This is the SINGLE always-mounted place we fire the 'questComplete' app
 * signal (sound) + the app-wide snackbar; PoskyView's own useProgress additionally bursts
 * confetti when that tab is open, and the shared cooldown stops a double-play. It is also
 * the ONE place a quest completion is reported into the live event feed (Task #59) — only
 * the renderer can match turn-ins against the posky dataset, so main can't detect this
 * itself. The report carries the QUEST link (the class's Plane of Sky Tests wiki page —
 * there are no per-quest pages) and, when the dataset names one, the reward item for the
 * event overlay's hover card. A quest with no known reward reports none: no fabricated

/**
 * THE TWO PREFERENCES FACTS THAT CHANGE WHERE THE PREFERENCES PANE CANNOT SEE THEM.
 *
 * The pane's cards seed from a warm snapshot (JOS-340, features/preferences/prefsSnapshot.ts) and
 * that cache is otherwise only ever written by a card's OWN reply — so anything moved from another
 * surface would be invisible in the pane until the next launch. Two things are:
 *
 *   * WHAT THE X DOES (JOS-139). The tray icon's menu carries the same checkbox, and it is used
 *     precisely while this window is hidden.
 *   * WHICH OVERLAYS ARE OPEN (JOS-408). The Appearance section's rows tag a row whose window is
 *     closed — the one control there whose honest answer to "what does pressing this change on
 *     screen" is "nothing yet" — and the thing that opens those windows is the TITLE BAR's Overlay
 *     menu, used with Preferences nowhere in sight. The card subscribes too, for a pane that is
 *     already open; this is what makes the NEXT mount right.
 *
 * Its own function rather than two more `const off…`s inside App's effect: that component is at the
 * repo's 100-code-line-per-function ceiling, and these two subscriptions are one idea.
