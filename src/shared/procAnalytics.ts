// A NEW shared file rather than an extension of shared/combat.ts, deliberately: three plans

// WORLD-MODEL POSITION (AGENTS.md):
//   law 1 — every count here comes from a line the game printed. The one derived judgement
//           ("this spell effect had no cast behind it, therefore it procced") is a LABELED
//           inference with a stated window, and it may never name a SOURCE — only a
//           co-occurrence. That is why `ProcLink` exists and `ProcSource` does not.
//   law 5 — every rate is ABSENT below its sample floor, never 0. `1 proc in a 2-second pull`
//           is not `30 ppm`.
//   law 6 — the log carries NO per-hit marker for any stance or invocation bonus, so most of
//           the roster's honest verdict is a sentence, not a number ('not-observable').
//   law 8 — everything here is an ADDITIVE index over damage already counted. Not one damage
//           total moves.

/**
 * Where a counted proc came from.
 *   'poison' — a rogue Strike emote. ALREADY modeled by Task #64's ProcAccum.strikes; the
 *              unified lane list PROJECTS that map rather than counting it a second time.
 *   'spell'  — a spell-effect line with no own cast behind it (see PROC_CAST_WINDOW_MS).
 *   'slay'   — the `(Slay Undead)` melee paren modifier: a proc that rides a swing, so its
 *              damage is NOT the damage it added (see ProcLaneView.marginalDamage).
 *   'aa'     — an INNATE AA proc that rides a swing and is counted from the line's paren
 *              modifier tally, the way `slay` is counted from the damage taxonomy. Today that
 *              is `(Finishing Blow)` and only that (JOS-437, report 01M0DNQQ41G1YA20N4ZM07HVWG:
 *              "The proc from Finishing Blow AA is not being listed anywhere (neither in melee
 *              nor under procs). Since it's a proc similar to slay undead AA proc, it should
 *              …[be]"). The reporter's analogy is the right one and the difference is only
 *              where the count is READ: Slay Undead was pulled into a damage CATEGORY of its
 *              own, so its swings left the melee lane and `byCategory` counts them; Finishing
 *              Blow was left in `melee` — correctly, its damage is a weapon swing's — so the
 *              only place it is counted is `SourceStat.mods`, which nothing rendered. Hence a
 *              lane read from the tally, and hence a separate origin: an `aa` lane has NO
 *              damage row of its own to tag (see `taggedSkills`), where a `slay` lane has the
 *              merged Slay Undead row. Its damage is "damage on swings that procced" exactly
 *              as slay's is, so it carries `marginalDamage` for the same reason.
 *   'click'  — NOT A PROC AT ALL, and that is the whole point of the value (JOS-438,
 *              report 01M0BS3FJW1YWP6ZNMM41HCMS2: "they are given ppm ratings in the dps
 *              breakdown, but they are not procs"). An instant item click prints the same
 *              nothing a proc does — one effect line, no cast line — so it reaches the same
 *              detector; what separates them is the player's OWN inventory naming the clicky
 *              (main/itemClickies.ts). A `click` lane counts the same firings and divides them
 *              the same way, and every surface that prints a rate for one says CLICKS, never
 *              procs. The reporter asked for exactly that: the rate they remember to press the
 *              button at is worth knowing; calling it a proc rate is not.
