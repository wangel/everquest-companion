// ============================================================================
// questTurnIns.ts — a Sky turn-in is an EVENT WITH A COUNT, not a terminal state.
// ============================================================================
//
// JOS-131, owner design 2026-08-09. A Sky farmer runs a quest more than once. Before this, a
// completed quest stayed 5/5 forever: the items it ate were subtracted from the model but the
// quest was pinned at complete, so a second copy of the Sphinx Claw you farmed for it was
// invisible. Now a turn-in SUBTRACTS what it consumed and COUNTS ITSELF, so the quest drops back
// to 0/5 and the badge says how many times you have handed it in. Multiple turn-ins are the
// default; nothing has to be enabled.
//
// THE LEDGER IS TWO SOURCES, MERGED BY INSTANT.
//   * DETECTED — the log's own turn-ins (`TurnInEvent.ts`, EQ's clock), re-derived from the
//     turnins module on every launch. The matching rule is unchanged and lives one file over
//     (renderer/features/posky/turnInCelebration.ts): the giver received every required item in
//     ONE trade.
//   * STORED — `ProgressState.questTurnIns`, which holds BOTH the detected instants (persisted,
//     so a truncated log or a character epoch cannot un-complete a quest) and the ones the user
//     recorded by hand.
// The union dedupes on the instant itself, so persisting a detected turn-in and then detecting
// it again is one turn-in, not two. That is the whole reason this is a list of instants rather
// than a tally: a tally forces `max(stored, detected)`, which cannot tell "I turned it in twice"
// from "I turned it in once and we saw it twice".
//   HONEST LIMIT: EQ log timestamps have one-second resolution (outputs/baseline.ts's header
// argues the same point for dumps), so two turn-ins of the SAME quest inside one second merge
// into one. A trade is several deliberate UI actions against an NPC, so this has no realistic
// shape; it is stated rather than hidden.
//
// THE LEGACY FLOOR. A store written before JOS-131 has `completedQuests` and no instants. Such a
// completion is real but UNDATED, so it contributes a FLOOR OF ONE to the count and nothing else.
// `completedQuests` keeps being written as the downgrade mirror (see shared/types.ts).
//
// AND THE FLOORS THIS LEDGER DOES NOT SEE (issue #27, then JOS-429): the Sky tab's DISPLAYED count
// is decided in two stages. This module resolves the persisted + detected evidence; the renderer
// then floors a quest at one on DERIVED evidence, on every read, never written back here. Two
// stated consequences: any OTHER consumer of this ledger reads the un-floored count and may say
// "not turned in" where the Sky tab says "Turned in"; and the downgrade mirror never contains a
// derived completion, so an older build shows those quests un-done — both are the price of keeping
// derived evidence out of the persisted record, paid on purpose.
//
// THE LADDER THOSE FLOORS SIT ON IS DEFINED HERE, at the bottom of this file
// (`DERIVED_EVIDENCE_RANK` / `derivedCompletion`), because the moment there were TWO of them the
// question "which one gets to speak" stopped being either renderer module's business. It is the
// classUnlocks.ts evidence model applied to completions: OBSERVED WINS, DERIVED IS LABELLED, and
// among derived sources the one closer to an ANSWER outranks the one closer to an inference.
//
// THERE IS NO "SINCE THE DUMP" COUNT ANY MORE (JOS-141). This file used to report a second count
// — how many turn-ins landed after the loaded dump was generated — because JOS-128 made a dump
// load RESET the held-count model, and a base of `dump + loot since the dump` already had every
// pre-dump turn-in taken out of it. The owner reverted the reset on 2026-08-09 after field-testing
// (a dump only covers what was open when it was written, so resetting to it ate banked Sky items),
// and the window went with it. Consumption is now windowed by SOURCE instead of by instant: the
// log owes every turn-in, a dump owes none, and the whole argument lives at the one place that
// applies it (renderer/features/inventory/reconcile.ts). One count, all time, is all this ledger
// has to answer.

// THE DERIVED-EVIDENCE LADDER (JOS-429) — which source gets to speak, and what it is called.
// ============================================================================
//
// The ledger above is EVENTS: a turn-in the log printed, a turn-in the user stated, a legacy
// completion. Everything below is the other kind of knowledge — a completion nobody recorded that
// something else nonetheless PROVES — and there are two of them now, which is why the ordering is
// a shared rule instead of an if-statement in whichever module happened to run second.
//
// THE ORDER, AND THE ARGUMENT FOR IT. `classUnlocks.ts` states the model this borrows: a turn-in is
// evidence of PROGRESS, the achievement line is evidence of the ANSWER. That distinction is exactly
// what separates the two derived sources here.
//
//   'achievement'  THE SERVER'S OWN ANSWER. `/outputfile achievements` carries one row per Sky
//                  quest reward and a status the SERVER decided; `C` means it has already ruled
//                  that you obtained that reward. Nothing about a bag, a trade or a wiki page can
//                  make that reading wrong, and it keeps being true after the item is destroyed,
//                  sold or left in a bank the export never opened.
//   'reward'       AN INFERENCE FROM POSSESSION (issue #27) — the reward is in your inventory
//                  export and it cannot be obtained any other way. Sound, and gated hard
//                  (rewardInference.ts refuses the two rewards that can move), but still a
//                  conclusion this app drew from a bag rather than an answer the game gave.
//
// WHY THE ORDER IS OBSERVABLE AT ALL, given that both floor the count at exactly 1 today: the LABEL
// differs, and the label is what the badge's hover and the undo control's refusal say out loud. A
// reader who cannot tell "the game says so" from "we worked it out from your bag" cannot tell which
// rows to trust — the same reason classUnlocks.ts labels its derived rows.
//
// THEY DO NOT ADD. Two sources vouching for one quest are two witnesses to the SAME turn-in, not
// two turn-ins: the reward in the bag is the reward the achievement is about. `max(ledger, 1)` is
// the best LOWER BOUND either can prove, which is the identical move reconcile.ts makes for held
// counts and rewardInference.ts already made for one witness.
//
// AND THE LEDGER STILL WINS OUTRIGHT. Any recorded evidence at all leaves the row exactly as the
// ledger said it — count and label both — because a derived floor can only ever say "at least
// once", and the ledger may already know it happened four times.
