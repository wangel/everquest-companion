// toast.ts — the CELEBRATION TOAST payload (docs/plans/celebration-toasts.md §2), its
// renderer→main request shape, the validator main re-runs on that request, and the pure
// formatter that turns an item's knowledge into the two-or-three stat lines the toast card
// prints.
//
// WHY A REQUEST AND A PAYLOAD. The producers are the main window's always-mounted celebration
// detectors (T4): they know the TITLE and, for a Sky turn-in, the reward item's NAME — nothing
// more. Main resolves that name into the embedded card (icon id, colour hint, stat lines) with
// `lookupItem`, because the overlay bundle is MUI-free and FETCHES NOTHING (T5): everything it
// draws arrives inside one push. So the wire carries two shapes:
//
//   ToastRequest  renderer → main   what happened + optionally the reward item's name
//   ToastPayload  main → overlay    the same, with the item card RESOLVED and pre-formatted
//
// THE VALIDATOR IS NOT A FORMALITY. `toast:show` is a renderer→main channel, and this repo's
// rule is that renderer input is re-validated at the handler rather than trusted because
// today's only caller is the app's own UI (the `sounds:getData` packId precedent). Everything
// here is a closed union or a capped string: an unknown kind, an over-long title or an
// unlisted focus view is DROPPED, never forwarded. The payload then crosses into a window
// that draws it, so "capped" is a rendering guarantee too — a 40 kB title cannot push the
// card off screen.
//
// Pure + dependency-free (types only), so `npm test` exercises it with no Electron.

 * complete" ALERTS already speak on these exact events — which made the picker a way to opt into
 * hearing the same kill twice, in a second place, with second volume rules. The alerts are the
 * audio path; this is the card. A store written by that build may still carry the two keys: they
 * are simply never read again, and dropping a read of optional keys needs no migration (the next

// button every other card now carries. A user who has never seen a celebration therefore meets a

// shipped as a title and a subtitle over a pointer cursor — and a pointer cursor is not an
// affordance in a window a player almost never hovers before deciding to ignore it. The card now
// prints the promise it was already keeping.
//
// THE WORDS LIVE HERE, NOT IN THE COMPONENT, for the reason TOAST_INTRO_BODY does: a string this
// small is still a PROMISE the app makes, and `npm test` can pin a promise in a pure module
// without Electron, a window or a screenshot.
//
// WHY THESE WORDS. "See what's new" is already the app's voice for "go read the thing that
// changed" — WhatsNewTeaser.tsx says exactly that about a release — and the destination this link
// lands on is literally titled "New at this level" (NewAtLevelPanel.tsx), so the label is a
// sentence the panel finishes rather than a generic "Open". The LEVEL is named because the card
// may be the second one in a stack and because a ding is about a number: "See what's new at 24"
// tells the reader both where they are going and which of the two cards they are answering.
//
// AND IT SPEAKS ONLY FOR DESTINATIONS IT CAN NAME. An unnamed view gets NO label rather than an
// invented one: the whole-card click keeps working exactly as before, and a card would rather
// under-promise than print a sentence about a place this function is guessing at (law 1's habit,
// applied to prose). Today that means the leveling anchor and nothing else — the Sky reward's
// destination is already visible as its reward block, and a boss kill names no destination at all.
