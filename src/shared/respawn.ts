// RESPAWN CLOCKS — the vocabulary shared by the main-process module, the Timers view and the
// Timers overlay (JOS-194). Pure: no Electron, no node, no React. Unit-tested by
// tests/respawnTimers.test.mts.
//
// WHAT THE FEATURE IS. A mob dies, the log prints a sentence saying so, and this app starts a
// clock. The owner's direction was explicit about where the number on that clock comes from:
// "the wiki is a bad primary source — build CUSTOM TIMERS TRIGGERED ON DEATH MESSAGES, with the
// wiki respawn value as a floor/default only." So the estimate is a three-rung ladder and the
// rungs are ranked by how much the app actually knows:
//
//   1. YOUR NUMBER      — you typed it. Nothing outranks a user who camped the spot.
//   2. YOUR KILLS       — the shortest gap between two deaths of this mob that you were present
//                         for, floored by the wiki (below).
//   3. THE WIKI         — the default before rung 2 has any evidence, and the floor under it.
//
// WHAT A DEATH→DEATH GAP ACTUALLY PROVES, stated honestly because the UI states it too. You
// cannot kill a mob before it spawns, so every gap you observe is `respawn + however long you
// took to find and re-kill it`. A gap is therefore an UPPER BOUND on the respawn, never a
// measurement of it, and the tightest bound your kills can produce is the SMALLEST gap. That is
// why rung 2 is a minimum and not a mean or a median: the minimum converges downward onto the
// truth as you camp, where an average would sit permanently above it and drift with how
// distracted you were. Every surface that prints rung 2 prints it as "≤", with the sample count
// beside it.
//
// WHY ONLY GAPS YOU WERE PRESENT FOR (`sameStay`). An upper bound is only useful if it is tight,
// and a gap spanning "I killed it Tuesday and came back Friday" is a true bound of three days
// that tells nobody anything. The log states exactly the thing that separates the two cases —
// the zone lines — so a gap counts as a sample only when BOTH deaths fall inside one continuous
// stay in the zone. A camped respawn produces samples; a return visit produces none. No timeout,
// no heuristic: it is the same "evidence, not a clock" rule the offline-gap work landed on.
//
// WHY THE WIKI IS A FLOOR AND NOT A TIEBREAK. Two different spawns can print the SAME NAME — a
// placeholder camp with two spawn points, or plain trash like `a froglok guk shaman` standing in
// pairs — and when they die minutes apart your minimum gap collapses to something far below the
// real cycle. That is the one failure mode rung 2 has, and the wiki number is the cheap guard
// against it: the estimate is never allowed below what the wiki states. It is not consulted for
// anything else, and where the wiki says nothing (85% of the mobs in the dungeons this ticket
// targets — see respawnWiki.ts for the measurement) rung 2 stands alone.
//
// WHAT THE APP NEVER DOES. It never claims the mob IS up: it says the clock ran out. A spawn
// this app did not see cannot be reported, a placeholder cycle can put the trash mob there
// instead, and none of that is in the log. `due` means "the estimate elapsed" and every label
// says so (world-model law 1, and law 6's "say what the log cannot say").
//
// TRACKING IS OPT-IN, PER MOB (owner ruling, 2026-08-10, prototype round 1). There is no rule
// that clocks a mob you did not ask about — not even "anything the wiki states a duration for",
// which is what the first prototype shipped and what the owner threw out after using it. The
// argument is the game's, not the UI's: EQ names are massively DUPLICATED (`a froglok guk
// shaman` is dozens of unrelated spawn points across four zones, and a name that means one mob
// in Befallen means trash in Guk), so a clock the player did not choose is a clock about a mob
// the app cannot identify. Clocking everything the wiki knows therefore produces confident
// countdowns for things nobody is camping. So: the Recently-killed panel is the DISCOVERY
// surface — it lists what has died, which costs nothing and claims nothing — and a clock exists
// only once the player clicks Watch or types a number. The wiki keeps both of its remaining
// jobs (the default estimate for a watched mob you have no gap for yet, and the floor under the
// gaps you do have); what it lost is the power to ADMIT a mob on its own.
//
// THE DISPLAY IS ZONE-SCOPED, THE DATA IS NOT (owner ruling, same round). The fold keeps every
// (zone, mob) it has seen — walking away from Guk must not throw away what Guk taught — but a
// respawn clock is only actionable where you are standing, and the overlay showing a mob due in
// a zone three loading screens away is noise on top of the game. So the surfaces FILTER by the
// zone the fold is currently in (`RespawnSnap.zone`, which is the module's own zone-stay state —
// the same field that decides whether a gap counts, never a second tracker): the floating window
// shows that zone and nothing else, and the Timers tab defaults to it with an explicit all-zones
// view for editing. `respawnInZone` below is the ONE comparison both surfaces call.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// SEEN: THE LOG NAMED IT, SO THE ROW SAYS SO (owner ruling, 2026-08-10, prototype round 3)
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The defect that produced this ruling is the sharpest one the feature has had. The owner was
// killing a watched mob that had spawned on time; he arrived late; the mob was ACTIVELY HITTING
// HIM — and the row read "due 4m ago". The countdown was not wrong about the estimate, it was
// wrong about the QUESTION: once the log is printing the mob's name, "when do I expect it" has
// been answered by the world, and the app was still reciting its guess.
//
// So a row now carries `seenTs` — the last instant the parse cascade produced an event NAMING
// this mob while the fold was in this row's zone — and a reading whose `seenTs` is newer than the
// clock's base reads UP rather than due. Nothing about the estimate changes; the row simply stops
// pretending the estimate is the best thing it knows.
//
// WHAT MARKS SEEN, and what does not (the coverage statement, kept here because the UI's honesty
// depends on it). The module subscribes to TYPED EVENTS, never to raw text — the parser is the
// only thing in this app that reads sentences, and a second regex sweep over `ev.raw` would be a
// second opinion that drifts (the `DamageEventE.verb` argument). The families that name an entity
// and therefore mark it seen are, by the shape of the name they carry:
//
//   combat   `damage` (attacker/target), `miss` (attacker/target), `heal` (healer/target),
//            `mitigation` is NOT included — it names a source only for the absorb shapes, which
//            the miss family already covers.
//   consider `consider` (mob) — sizing something up is the purest sighting the log has.
//   holds    `cc`, `ccWake`, `charm`, `uncharm` (mob) — a mez/root/charm landing or breaking.
//   spells   `resist` (caster/target), `otherCastBegin` (caster), `buffApply` (target),
//            `poisonProc` (target).
//
// AND WHAT CANNOT MARK IT, stated rather than glossed:
//   * A MOB STANDING THERE PRINTS NOTHING. EQ logs interactions, not presence, so a spawn nobody
//     touches and nobody cons is invisible to this app forever. `seen` is "the log mentioned it",
//     never "it is up"; the absence of `seen` is not evidence of anything at all.
//   * MOB SPEECH IS GONE BY DESIGN. Growls and emotes are quoted speech and the scrub drops them
//     (AGENTS.md), and nothing parses them, so a mob that only talks is not seen.
//   * A CORPSE IS NOT A SIGHTING. `loot`'s `source` names a corpse and `death`'s `name` names the
//     thing that just stopped existing; neither marks seen, or every kill would flip its own row
//     up at the instant it went down.
//   * `spellEmote` IS DELIBERATELY OUT. It is documented as a PERMISSIVE candidate stream full of
//     unrelated flavor whose `subject` the buffs module only trusts after repetition; admitting it
//     here would flip rows up on hunger messages.
//   * THE NAME IS STILL JUST A NAME. Two spawns of `a froglok guk shaman` are one key to this app
//     (law 13's whole argument), so a sighting of the OTHER one marks this row seen. That is the
//     same limit the clock itself has and the UI does not pretend otherwise.
//   * THE SIGHTING MUST BE IN THIS ROW'S ZONE. Rows are keyed `(zone, mob)` and only the entry for
//     the zone the fold is standing in can be marked, so a Guk sighting never lights a Befallen row.
//
// A SIGHTING NEVER AUTO-ADJUSTS THE SCHEDULE (the second half of the same ruling, and the more
// important half). Seeing a mob proves it is UP; it says nothing whatever about WHEN it spawned —
// it could have been standing there for an hour before anyone swung at it. So the clock's base is
// still the death message and only the death message, exactly as before. What the user gets is an
// explicit affordance on a seen row — "start the clock from this sighting" — which moves the base
// to that sighting instant and marks the row `basis: 'sighting'` so every surface can say the
// number came from a judgement the user made rather than a line the game printed. It exists
// because YOUR kill is not the only way a cycle restarts: a group-mate's kill is filtered out by
// `isCountedKill`, and a mob you never re-killed leaves the clock frozen on a stale death. A death
// message afterwards takes the base straight back (`baseTs` is whichever is later), so the normal
// death-driven cycle resumes on the next kill with nothing to undo.
//
// THE CONFIRMATION IS SESSION STATE, not a preference: it lives in the fold beside the deaths it
// competes with, and a relaunch re-derives the fold from the log — which has never heard of it.
// Persisting a judgement about one spawn of one mob would outlive the spawn it was about.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// UNWATCH LIVES ON THE MOB, WHEREVER YOU MEET IT (owner ruling, 2026-08-10, prototype round 4)
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Watching was already a per-mob act — you meet a mob in the Recently-killed panel and click Watch
// beside it. STOPPING was not: the only way out was to find the name again in the global watch
// list at the bottom of the tab and delete it there. So the two halves of one decision lived in
// two different places, and the half you reach for while a clock is wrong in front of you (over
// the game, mid-camp, the mob a duplicate name the app cannot tell apart) was the one that made
// you go looking. The ruling makes them symmetric: wherever a surface names a watched mob, that
// mob carries its own way out — its clock row in the Timers tab, its clock row in an INTERACTIVE
// floating window, and its Recently-killed entry, where Watch and Unwatch are now the same
// control in the same place saying the opposite thing.
//
// A WATCH IS A NAME, SO UNWATCH IS A NAME TOO. The list is keyed by the canonical mob name and a
// watch deliberately follows that name into every zone you kill it in, so removing it from any
// surface removes it everywhere — including a clock for the same name running in a zone you are
// not standing in. Round 4 put that sentence on the control's tooltip; the owner deleted the
// tooltip in round 7 (the control speaks for itself), so it is argued HERE and pinned by
// tests/respawnUnwatch.test.mts instead of recited on screen — which is the same bargain round 5
// struck with every other caption on this feature.
//
// AND IT THROWS AWAY NOTHING BUT THE WATCH. The kills, the gaps and the sightings are the fold's,
// derived from the log; the watch list is the only thing the log cannot state. So unwatching drops
// the row and keeps the history behind it, the mob is still offered in Recently killed the moment
// after (`RespawnCandidate.watched` flips back to false), and watching it again brings back the
// same clock with the same numbers — which is what makes an unwatch on a floating window safe
// enough to be one click with no confirmation.
//
// THE ROW SURFACES OFFER ONLY THE UNWATCH HALF, and that is not an asymmetry: a clock row exists
// only because the mob is watched (the opt-in ruling is the admission rule), so "Watch" on one
// would be a control that can never be in its other state. The Recently-killed entry is the one
// surface that meets both kinds of mob, and it is the one that toggles.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE ROW ANSWERS "IS IT WORTH WAITING FOR" (owner ruling, 2026-08-10, prototype round 6)
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A countdown says WHEN. The question a player standing on a spawn point is actually asking is
// whether to keep standing there, and that is a question about LOOT. So a respawn row now reveals,
// on mouseover, the mob's drop table — the wiki's list plus what we have looted off it ourselves —
// beside what we know about its respawn.
//
// BOTH HALVES ARE THINGS THIS APP ALREADY HAD, and the ruling was explicit that neither may be
// rebuilt. The drops are `MobKnowledge` through the cache-first `mobs:lookup` door — the same
// answer the `/con` hover card, the mob page and the consider strip draw — split by the one fold
// in shared/mobDrops.ts. The card is the same component (`lib/hoverCards.tsx`, moved down from the
// event overlay so both windows can draw it). And the timer half is `respawnProvenance` verbatim:
// round 5 cut that sentence to the facts the row does not print and CAPPED it by test, so round 6
// carries it into the card as a titled block rather than growing a second tooltip beside it.
//
// AND THE CARD IS IN THE APP ONLY (owner ruling, round 7 — this AMENDS the paragraph above). Round
// 6 also wired the card into the floating window, behind the interactive gate. The owner used it and
// threw that half out: a 300px window whose whole job is a countdown cannot afford a 300px card on
// top of it, and it "takes the overlay over too completely". So the floating window is back to
// round 5's shape exactly — plain rows, with `respawnProvenance` on the row's native `title`, and a
// LOCKED window still getting neither because it is click-through and receives no mouse events at
// all. The card stays on the Timers tab, where there is room for it, and it is the SAME shared
// component either way (`lib/hoverCards.tsx` keeps its home: the event overlay's `/con` rows still
// draw it, so the move round 6 made is not undone, only one of its two callers is).
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE MOB IS THE PLACE, AND THE LIST AT THE BOTTOM DIES (owner ruling, round 7)
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Round 4 put unwatch on the mob and left "Your watches" standing at the bottom of the tab, because
// typing a number felt like list work. It was not: the list was a second inventory of the same mobs,
// sorted differently, carrying one control the mob itself did not have. So it is gone, and the two
// things it held — the removal and the custom-seconds box — are on the mob's RUNNING entry, which is
// where the player is already looking when they decide the number is wrong.
//
// AND THE RUNNING ENTRY NOW SHOWS ITS WORKING. The row printed the ESTIMATE and the rung; what it
// never printed was the evidence — the actual death→death gaps this fold measured for this mob in
// this zone. `gapsMs` carries them (newest first, `RESPAWN_MAX_GAPS` of them) and the row prints
// them under the countdown when there are any. They are the same samples `observedMs` is the
// minimum of, so nothing new is derived and nothing is claimed that was not already claimed: every
// one of them is an upper bound, which is what the hover has always said.
//
// THE ONE LIMIT THIS CREATES, stated rather than discovered. A watch whose clock is not on screen
// has no row to carry its controls — a mob you watch in Guk while standing in Befallen (switch to
// all zones), or one you have never killed at all (nothing has started a clock, so its
// Recently-killed entry is where it lives). The alternative was keeping a global list on screen for
// that case, which is the thing the ruling removed. (Round 7 listed a third case here — a clock the
// linger sweep had retired — and round 8 deleted the sweep, so that one is gone: a watched mob this
// fold has a death for always has a row, and the box is always on it.)
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A WATCHED MOB ALWAYS HAS A ROW (owner ruling, round 8 — this AMENDS the linger everywhere above)
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE DEFECT, from live play again: the owner came back to the app HOURS after his kills, clicked
// Watch on a Recently-killed entry, saw the button flip to Unwatch — and Running still read "no
// clocks running". Nothing was lost on the way: the write persisted, the module bumped its revision
// (round 2's law held) and the delta reached the renderer. The row was BORN PAST THE LINGER. The
// fold ran the sweep below on every row it built, so a clock whose estimate had elapsed more than
// RESPAWN_LINGER_MS ago — which is what a five-hour-old death is, always — was published as no row
// at all. The one mob the user had just asked for by name was the one mob the module refused to
// show, and a successful click with no visible effect is the worst thing a control can do.
//
// SO THE SWEEP IS GONE FROM THE FOLD. A watched mob this fold holds a death for ALWAYS publishes a
// row, however old that death is. The list stays bounded the way the rest of the feature is: by the
// opt-in ruling (rows exist only for names the player asked for), by the zone scope, and by
// RESPAWN_MAX_ROWS — never by a clock silently retiring a mob the user is still watching.
//
// AND THE LINGER KEEPS THE TWO JOBS THAT ARE NOT "DELETE THE ROW" (owner: it "may tidy seen-state
// but must never make a watched row vanish while watched"). Both are readings, not admissions:
//
//   1. IT BOUNDS THE SEEN STATE. `UP` is the one label in this feature that claims a mob is
//      standing there, and it is allowed to because the log printed the name. A line from ninety
//      minutes ago prints nothing about now, so evidence older than the window stops reading UP.
//      Before round 8 the sweep did this by DELETING the row, which is why round 3 had to spare
//      seen rows from it; the state simply expires now, and the row stays.
//   2. IT MARKS A LONG-ELAPSED CLOCK STALE. A countdown that ran out five hours ago has stopped
//      being a countdown: "due 5h 12m ago" is a growing number about a thing this app knows nothing
//      about. So past the same window the reading is `stale`, and the surfaces say so in the two
//      honest ways there are — `due long ago` when an estimate elapsed, `awaiting next death` when
//      there was never an estimate to elapse — draw no progress bar (there is no estimate left
//      running to draw), and sort it UNDER every live clock. It is the least actionable row on the
//      screen and it is still on the screen.
//
// THE NEXT DEATH IS THE WHOLE RECOVERY, and it needs no code: `baseTs` moves to the new death, the
// reading stops being stale in the same tick, and the normal cycle resumes. A sighting does the
// same for the seen half. Nothing has to be re-watched, re-typed or re-discovered.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE NUMBER IS A THING YOU EDIT, NOT A THING YOU TYPE INTO A BOX (owner ruling, round 9)
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ROUND 7'S SECONDS BOX IS SUPERSEDED, and the reason is the one the owner gave for every other
// move in this feature: the control was in the right PLACE and was the wrong SHAPE. A bare `sec`
// field sitting on a countdown asks the player to (a) know that the app wants seconds, (b) convert
// the number they actually hold — "it's about 44 minutes" — into 2640 in their head, and (c) decide
// whether to overrule the app while looking at none of the evidence the app used. Three demands, on
// a row 30 pixels tall, for the one decision on this surface that outranks everything the fold
// learned.
//
// SO THE ROW CARRIES AN EDIT AFFORDANCE AND THE DECISION HAPPENS IN A MODAL, which is the first
// surface in this feature with room to state its case. What the modal holds is exactly the evidence
// the decision needs and nothing invented for it: the hover card (the mob, its drops, the round-5
// provenance sentence), ALL the gaps the fold measured rather than the minimum they reduce to, what
// the wiki said in the wiki's own words, and a LINK to the page those words came from — because
// "the wiki says 9.5 min" is a claim the player is entitled to go and check, and this app has had
// the page title in `WikiRespawn.page` since the floor was scraped.
//
// AND THE DURATION IS ONE UNIT WITH ITS SOURCE. Until this round the Running entry printed the rung
// ("wiki default") at the left end of a line and the duration at the right end of it, which reads as
// two facts that happen to share a row rather than as one fact and its provenance. They are now one
// bordered thing — `respawnDurationText` and `respawnSourceLabel` inside one box, with the edit
// affordance attached to it — so the sentence a glance reads is "9m 30s, from the wiki", never
// "9m 30s" and, separately, "wiki default".
//
// AND AN EDITED ROW IS IN A STATE, NOT MERELY HOLDING A DIFFERENT NUMBER. Rung 1 already existed
// (`customMs`, and `resolveRespawn` has always ranked it first), so the MODEL half of this round is
// nearly nothing; what was missing is that the screen said "your number" in the same grey as
// "wiki default" and left the player no way to tell, at a glance across a camp's worth of clocks,
// which of them they had overruled. `respawnOverridden` is the one definition of that state and both
// surfaces paint it — the tab in the theme's gold, the floating window in a colour it uses nowhere
// else. The overlay shows the STATE and carries none of the editing: a modal over the game is the
// round-7 card's mistake with a bigger footprint, and a locked window has no clicks to give anyway.
//
// AND THERE IS A WAY BACK. The clear control returns the row to what the ladder calculated, and the
// modal says what that number IS before you press it (`respawnCalculated` re-runs the ladder with
// rung 1 removed) — a revert whose result you cannot see is a dare, not a control.
//
// THE PARSER IS ONE FUNCTION AND ITS GRAMMAR IS A WHITELIST (`parseRespawnDuration`). Plain seconds
// stay the default because that is what the retired box took and what a store entry holds; the
// shorthand exists because "44m" is what the player is actually holding. Everything the grammar does
// not fully consume is REFUSED and says so, rather than being half-read into a number — the same
// rule `parseWikiRespawn` is written under, for the same reason: a fabricated countdown is worse
// than no countdown. It is NOT that function reused, and deliberately: the wiki grammar refuses a
// bare number (a page saying "600" has not said seconds) and forgives prose the wiki prints
// ("every", "approximately"), and a text field the user is typing into wants the exact opposite of
// both.

 * their second line, and the bar keeps running), but the loudest thing on the row is no longer a
 * countdown that has been overtaken by events. This is also the ONE label in the feature that
 * claims a mob is there — and it may, because unlike `due` it is reporting a line the game printed
 * rather than a clock this app ran.
 *
 * AND A STALE ROW STOPS COUNTING (round 8). Once the estimate has been elapsed longer than the
 * linger, `due 5h 12m ago` is a number that grows forever about a mob this app knows nothing about;
 * a row that never had an estimate is in the same position with `+5h 12m`. Both say what is
 * actually true instead — the estimate is long gone, and what would restart the clock is the next
 * death. The two spellings are constants because three surfaces read them and round 5's law is that
 * a string on screen has ONE home.
 *
 * `fmt` is injected because the app's ONE duration formatter lives in the renderer
 * (features/buffs/format.ts) and this module is pure. Injecting it is what keeps that rule — one

 * THE GRAMMAR, stated so the modal's help text and this function cannot drift:
 *
 *   * A BARE NUMBER IS SECONDS. `90` → 90 s, `90.5` → 91 s (rounded, because the store holds whole
 *     seconds). This is the default the owner asked for and the shape every existing store entry is
 *     already in.
 *   * SHORTHAND IS ONE OR MORE `<number><unit>` TERMS, units strictly DESCENDING: `44m`,
 *     `44m 30s`, `1h 10m`, `1h10m30s`, `2d`. Long forms are accepted (`44 min`, `44 minutes`,
 *     `1 hour`), the space between number and unit is optional, and terms may be separated by
 *     whitespace or a comma.
 *   * DESCENDING IS ENFORCED, so `30s 44m` and `44m 44m` are refused. A repeated or reordered unit
 *     means something the field cannot know — is `44m 44m` eighty-eight minutes, or a typo? — and
 *     the honest answer is to refuse rather than to pick.
 *   * THE WHOLE STRING MUST BE CONSUMED. That is the entire refusal mechanism: `44m 30` runs out of
 *     units at the bare `30`, `44x` at the `x`, `1e3` at the `e`, `-5` at the sign, `abc` at the `a`.
 *   * A COLON FORM IS REFUSED, deliberately. `1:30` is minutes:seconds on a wiki page and hours:
 *     minutes on a clock, this app has an argued reading of it for wiki text ONLY
 *     (`parseWikiRespawn`'s readClock, which the catalog's own camps prove), and guessing which one
 *     a player meant would put a number on a countdown that is out by a factor of sixty. `1h 30m`
 *     and `1m 30s` both say it in one keystroke more.
 *
 * The range is checked AFTER the grammar, so a readable duration that is simply too long says so
 * instead of reading as gibberish.
