//
// See AGENTS.md → Architecture. Both feeders (the startup scan and the live Tailer) push
// onto ONE LogBus; the ModuleRegistry folds every event into each extension module and the
// CombatEngine folds it into its own state machine.
//
// This module CONSTRUCTS that world and wires it, at import time, in the order the design
// requires — the module instances (via `modules/wiring.ts`, which owns the list and its order),
// the registry host that pushes `module:delta`, and the two bus subscriptions. index.ts imports
// it as the composition root's first act; `session.ts` drives it (scan → tail → reset on
// character switch).
//
// The module ORDER is load-bearing and is documented in modules/wiring.ts, beside the
// constructions. Do not reorder them. That file is Electron-free on purpose: `npm run bench:replay`
// folds the same modules in the same order OUTSIDE Electron to attribute the startup fold per
// consumer (JOS-55), and it must not be holding a private copy of the list.

 * celebration detectors), so no delta ever describes the rest of it. A charm or an Ensnare that
 * genuinely survived the fold was in the model, in the main window, and missing from the overlay
