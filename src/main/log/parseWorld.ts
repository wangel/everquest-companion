// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE ZONE NAME IS THE ONLY THING THAT STATES A DIFFICULTY (JOS-166)
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// EQ Legends encodes instance difficulty in the zone name, and nowhere else: no kill line, no
// lockout line and no instance-creation notice carries one (the sweep is quoted in the header of
// renderer/features/bosses/lockout.ts). So `zoneTier` is where the app decides what a kill's
// difficulty was, and everything downstream inherits whatever it decides here.
//
// THE THREE WORLDS. A full-log sweep of every `You have entered <X>.` in the owner's 1.4M-line
// log (2026-08-09, read-only) yields exactly these shapes, and they fall into three kinds:
//
//   INSTANCED, DIFFICULTY NAMED — the adjective is the whole rule (d1..d4):
//     You have entered The Plane of Hate - Solo 4 (Refined).
//     You have entered Nagafen's Lair - Group 3 (Fused).
//     You have entered Najena 4 (Refined).                  ← no Solo/Group word, still instanced
//     You have entered The Plane of Sky 1 (Awakened).
//
//   INSTANCED, NO ADJECTIVE — the BASE difficulty, d0, and a real one (7 in the log):
//     You have entered The Plane of Hate - Solo.
//     You have entered Nagafen's Lair - Solo.
//     You have entered The Permafrost Caverns - Solo.
//
//   NOT INSTANCED — the open world, which carries no lockout of any kind:
//     You have entered The Plane of Hate.
//     You have entered Innothule Swamp.
//
// WHY d0 IS NOW ITS OWN ANSWER (owner decision, 2026-08-09, corroborated by the community wiki):
// a raid target has FIVE weekly lockouts, d0 through d4, and the owner clears all five most
// weeks. The base instance is a difficulty like any other; what it is NOT is the open world, and
// the suffix is what tells them apart. Until this ticket all three kinds decoded to 0, so an
// open-world kill and a base-instance clear were the same fact to every consumer.
//
// FOUR ANSWERS, NOT FIVE. `TIER_UNKNOWN` covers both "no zone line has been seen yet" (an empty
// string — the kills module's state before the scan reaches one) and "an instance whose
// adjective this app has never decoded". The second used to fall through to 0; a parenthetical
// the table does not know is still unmistakably an INSTANCE (the base difficulty never prints
// one), so calling it d0 would be inventing the one fact the line failed to state (law 1).
