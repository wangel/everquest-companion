// The single parse pass. `parseEvent(raw, seq)` turns one raw log line into a
// canonical LogEvent (or null when the line isn't a timestamped log line at all).
//
// This ABSORBS both former regex batteries — the content matchers that lived in
// parse.ts (loot/zone/kill/offer/trade/level/AA) and the combat matchers from
// combat/parse.ts (melee/spell/dot/ds/charm/uncharm/death/zone) — plus the two
// NEW parse-only families (heal, miss). It preserves every documented fix (verb
// conjugations, incoming-DS variant, charm-spell stems, AA improved format,
// singular/plural points, caster-less DoT → attacker:null).
//
// PERF: a full 68MB replay must stay ~seconds. The old scan ran cheap substring
// pre-filters before the regex battery; that logic now lives INSIDE parseEvent as
// an implementation detail (no caller-visible pre-filters). The hot path for the
// overwhelming majority of lines — misses and avoided swings — is gated by a
// single `includes(', but ')` check before any regex runs, and the ubiquitous
// combat/heal/loot families are each guarded by a substring probe. Lines matching
// nothing return a shared UNKNOWN-shaped result cheaply.
//
// FACTORING: the line-shape cascade is split across four sibling modules by family
// (parseCombat / parseCasts / parseWorld, over parseCommon's shared context+names).
// The CASCADE ORDER below is SEMANTIC, not cosmetic — several families overlap on
// purpose and are disambiguated by which one is offered the line first (the resist
// family tests YOUR form before the named-caster form because 712 spell names
// contain `'s`; the spell-landing emote is matched LAST so it can never shadow a
// real family; item merges come after loot so an auto-merge-on-pickup stays one
// 'combined' loot event). NEVER reorder CLASSIFIERS.

  classifyLoc,
  // SESSION frame (login / camp-out / camp-abort). Beside the zone rule because they answer

  // first. It cannot shadow anything regardless: a full-log replay measured all 5,002 lines it

  // The AA potion quaff, beside the AA economy it modifies. An EXACT string match on a line

  classifyAaPotion,

  // that were `{kind:'unknown'}` beforehand: all 4,321 begin, 4,285 finished, 4,232 forget and
  // 474 spell-set lines of the owner's 2,048,450-line log. So the position is legibility.
  classifySpellGems,
  // CLASS EVIDENCE (class-combo inference Wave 1). Both are gated on a substring probe and
  // both were MEASURED to claim only lines that previously produced `{kind:'unknown'}` (all

  classifySpecialAttack,
