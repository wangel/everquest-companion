// IPC: the performance HUD + the startup profile (docs/plans/perf-profiling.md).
//
// Four channels, and the interesting one is the SETTER: flipping the pref is only half the job —
// this session's timers have to come into line with it too. One handler doing both is what makes
// "off means no timer exists" true right now rather than after the next launch, and it is the
// same discipline `applyTelemetryEnabled` uses for the analytics switch.
//
// THE COMPOSITION SEAM. `src/main/perf.ts` deliberately does not import the store: the sampler
// is a mechanism, the pref is a policy, and keeping the dependency one-way means the store can
// stay reachable from module scope without a cycle. So the DECISION lives here (and, at launch,
// in the composition root) — both of which already import both halves.
//
// VALIDATED AT THE HANDLER, never trusted because today's only caller is the app's own UI (the
// `sounds:getData` rule). A non-boolean is not a guess: it leaves the pref exactly as it was.
// `perf:rendererHydrated` carries no payload at all, so there is nothing to validate — it is a
// SEND (fire-and-forget), because a startup mark must never be something the renderer waits on.

  // A REPEAT SEND IS A RELOAD, NOT A BUG (JOS-99). The renderer's own send-once guard is module
  // scope, so every reload resets it — and this app reloads windows on purpose: the dev watcher
  // does it on every renderer edit, `did-fail-load` retries once, and `render-process-gone`
  // recovers by reloading. Each of those re-mounts the hook and sends this again. Handing that to
  // `markStartupPhase` produced "startup phase 'rendererHydrated' was marked twice" in errors.log
  // every single time, which is a large share of the fleet's `mainErrorLogLines` for an event that
  // means the recovery WORKED.
  //
  // So the ignoring happens HERE, at the one channel that can legitimately repeat, and `addMark`
  // is left exactly as strict as it was: every other phase is marked once from a single main-side
  // call site, where a duplicate really is a wiring bug and still earns its logged refusal. The
  // profile keeps the FIRST hydration — the launch's own — because that is the number "how long
  // did this app take to draw its interface" is asking for; a reload three minutes later is not
  // part of the launch and must not overwrite it.
