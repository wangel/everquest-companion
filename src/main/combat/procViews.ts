// THE PROC-LEDGER SERIALIZATION (docs/plans/proc-analytics.md §6) — one segment's `Agg` plus
// the session state timeline, turned into the `ProcsView` the renderer draws.
//
// `buildProcsView` MOVED here verbatim from segmentViews.ts, per plan §6: it was already the
// biggest single function in that file, and the new lane / rate / state / attribution assembly
// would have pushed segmentViews.ts past the 400-code-line ceiling with an EMPTY ratchet.
//
// ADDITIVE ONLY (law 8). Everything added here is a COUNT or an INDEX over damage the meter
// already counted — `directDamage` is read back out of the same `Agg` the bars come from, never
// accumulated a second time. Not one damage total moves; the golden windows pin that exactly.
//
// THE THREE COUNTING RULES, because collapsing any of them is how a proc meter starts lying:
//
//   1. A POISON lane counts EMOTES, and reports tick damage separately. `Blood Siphon Strike`
//      in w41 is four emotes, fourteen dot ticks for 658, and thirteen heal lines for 611 —
//      three numbers, each correct for its own question, and none of them is the sum of the
//      others. `count` is the emote count (the proc fired four times); `directDamage` is what
//      the ticks delivered; `directHeal` is what the taps returned.
//   2. A poison lane SUPPRESSES the spell-proc lane of the same name. `Asp Venom Strike` prints
//      both an emote and a `poison damage by Asp Venom Strike` line for ONE proc; emitting both
//      lanes would count that proc twice in the ppm headline.
//   3. A SLAY lane's `directDamage` is "damage on swings that PROCCED slay", NOT "damage slay
//      added" — the swing was going to land anyway. The excess over an ordinary swing rides in
//      `marginalDamage` with its assumption stated in the type.
//
// THE LINK FEED (§2.1 `ProcLink`), which used to be the hole in this file. `ProcLaneView.linked` is now
// filled from the per-state firing split `SpellProcLane.byState` carries, against the per-state
// swing exposure `ProcAccum.swingsByState` carries — BOTH folded on ingest, because the event
// ring is capped, truncated and absent entirely for zone sessions, so a link derived from it
// would be silently wrong exactly where the sample is biggest.
//
// SPELL LANES ONLY, and the two absences are deliberate rather than pending:
//   - a POISON lane's link to its own coat is TAUTOLOGICAL — an Asp Venom Strike cannot fire
//     without asp venom on the blade, so 'exclusive' there restates the mechanic instead of
//     measuring anything. (Its firings are also folded in procRouting.ts, not on this path.)
//   - a SLAY lane's count comes from the damage taxonomy, not from a proc fold, and its
//     `directDamage` is "damage on swings that procced" rather than damage the proc ADDED — so
//     rolling it up as a state's exact contribution would overstate it by a whole swing each.
// Both keep an empty list, which is the same discipline as everything else here: a number is
// absent when the sample cannot support it, never zero-filled.

 *     damage". That reasoning cost the owner the four Strikes they actually care about:
 *     Weakening, Clumsiness, Stunning and Banishing deal nothing at all, so the drill showed
 *     them only when a RESIST created the row and then labelled them `0 landed · N resisted`.
 *     A damage-less lane with landings now gets its tag and its row (see `effectLandings`), and
 *     that row reads `0 dmg · N landed`. (2026-08-04, overturned.)
 *   - an `aa` lane is turned away outright (JOS-437). Finishing Blow rides a swing and keeps it
 *     in the 'melee' category, so there is NO row that is the proc: its damage sits inside
 *     `Slash`, `Bash`, `Strike` and the rest, mixed with the ordinary swings that dominate them.
 *     Both ways to tag it anyway are worse than not tagging it — annotating the weapon rows
 *     would print `proc · N ppm` on rows that are ~99% ordinary attacks (the JOS-438 complaint,
 *     arriving from the other side), and minting a `Finishing Blow` row would show damage the
 *     meter is already showing under the weapon. So the lane states itself in the Procs panel,

/**
 * THE FINISHING-BLOW LANE (JOS-437) — the other swing-borne AA, and the one that was listed
 * NOWHERE. Report 01M0DNQQ41G1YA20N4ZM07HVWG, verbatim: "The proc from Finishing Blow AA is not
 * being listed anywhere (neither in melee nor under procs). Since it's a proc similar to slay
 * undead AA proc, it should either have it's combat damage listing component, or at least
 * listed under procs."
 *
 * THE REPORT IS EXACTLY RIGHT AND THE ANALOGY IS EXACTLY RIGHT. `(Finishing Blow)` has been
 * parsed since Task #51 — `parseModifiers` even recombines the two words by name — and
 * `tallyModifiers` has been counting it, with its damage, on `SourceStat.mods` all along. What
 * was missing is that NOTHING RENDERED THAT MAP. `SourceRoundsView.modifiers` carries it onto
 * the wire and no component reads it; the drill groups by skill, so the damage is really there
 * but spread invisibly across Slash/Bash/Strike; the timeline shows the modifier only in one
 * event's hover. So the honest description of the defect is not "unparsed" and not "missing a
 * registry row" — it is a counted fact with no surface. This gives it one.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A CATEGORY, where Slay Undead is one. A category MOVES the damage out of
 * 'melee', and Slay Undead's move was a user directive with a mechanism behind it (a holy proc
 * against undead is arguably not a weapon hit). Finishing Blow's damage IS a weapon swing's —
 * bigger, from the same swing — and pulling ~1,600 of the owner's melee lines into a category
 * of their own would change every melee mean, the swing denominators and the drill's shape to
 * fix a listing problem. Law 8's tripwire says the cheap fix is the right one here: this lane
 * MOVES NO DAMAGE. It reads the tally that was already being kept.
 *
 * THE BASELINE, and it differs from slayLanes' by one subtraction (see ProcLaneView.
 * marginalDamage). Slay swings LEFT the melee category, so `melee` there is already the
 * ordinary body. Finishing Blow swings did NOT, so `melee` here still contains them — and it
 * is the mean of the swings the proc did NOT ride that the excess is meaningful against.
 * Measured on the owner's whole log: 66.3 ordinary against 167.8 with the modifier, so the
 * marginal is roughly one and a half extra swings per firing and is emphatically not zero.
 *
 * EMITTED ONLY WHEN IT FIRED, exactly as the slay lane is: a permanent 0-count row on every
 * fight that never dropped anything below the threshold is noise.
