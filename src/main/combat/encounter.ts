//
//   TIMING axis (damage only) — LINGER_MS is measured against the encounter's last
//                 ATTRIBUTED DAMAGE. After every engaged hostile instance is gone,
//                 wait this long with no new damage before finalizing at the last
//                 damage ts: the linger absorbs the trailing DoT tick / cleanup swing.
//                 Nothing else may touch this clock — firstHit/lastHit/DPS/activeMs
//                 are damage-derived (AGENTS.md law 8).
//   PRESENCE axis (any evidence) — whether an engaged instance is still IN the fight,
//                 tracked per instance in Encounter.engagedSeen and refreshed by any
//                 observation of it: landed damage, misses in either direction,
//                 resists, CC, and heals it gives or receives. Presence never opens or
//                 extends an encounter; it only vetoes closing one.
//
//   PRESENCE_GONE_MS — how long a LIVE (not retired) engaged instance must go without
//                 ANY presence evidence before the death-close treats it as gone. A
//                 RETIRED instance is gone immediately (its death is the evidence; the
//                 LINGER_MS damage window still covers trailing hits), so this window
//                 only governs mobs that are still alive and simply quiet. It is
//                 deliberately 4× LINGER_MS because real fights go quiet for many
//                 seconds at a time: miss/dodge/parry streaks land nothing, mob cast
//                 phases (Stun/Root/Healing) produce no swings at all, a player stun
//                 stops YOUR damage, and the log flushes in multi-second batches while
//                 the closure is also evaluated against the WALL clock from
//                 snapshot(now). A genuinely fled mob still closes at
//                 FALLBACK_IDLE_MS — 3× sooner than it would if we waited that out.
