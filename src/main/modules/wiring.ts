// ============================================================================
// wiring.ts — the ordered module set, constructed in ONE place and folded in two.
// ============================================================================
//
// pipeline.ts is the app's composition root and is Electron-bound by design: it reaches for the
// settings store, the windows it pushes deltas to, and the two knowledge lookups that touch
// userData and the network. Nothing outside Electron can import it.
//
// The startup fold, though, is exactly the thing `npm run bench:replay` needs to take apart
// (JOS-55): which consumer spends the 31 microseconds every event costs. The bench measures that
// IN PROCESS — no Electron, no window, no IPC — and an attribution table built from a hand-copied
// list of modules would describe a pipeline nobody ships. One module missing, or two swapped, and
// the percentages are about a different program.
//
// So the CONSTRUCTION and the REGISTRATION ORDER live here, Electron-free, with every impure
// dependency injected. pipeline.ts calls it with the real store/window/lookup deps and re-exports
// the instances it always exported; tests/bench/foldArm.mts calls it with stubs. There is one list,
// and it is this one.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE: the bus, the combat engine, the epoch/session detectors and the registry host.
// Those are three lines of wiring each and both callers want them wired differently (the bench
// times the engine's subscription, production pushes deltas over IPC), so they stay at their call
// sites. This file owns the modules and their order, and nothing else.
