// kills module — the KillMap (per-mob count / best instance tier / first+last
// seen). Reuses the pure isCountedKill filter + recordKill fold from reducers.ts
// so the count semantics stay identical to the legacy tracker. Delta = only the
// per-mob entries that changed since the last flush; the renderer merges them in.
//
// THE CREDIT JOIN (2026-08-05, owner-reported: "it looks like it's celebrating even when I'm not
// the killer of the boss — I'm in open world and somebody killed [it]"). Every kill this module
// counts is a kill of that mob — a world fact, and the roster's defeated state is right to record
// it. But a kill is YOURS only when the log paid you for it, and the log says so in exactly one
// way: an experience line immediately BEFORE the slain line, same second (the sweep in
// progression.ts). That covers the group case for free — a group-mate's killing blow pays party
// experience, which is still an exp line in YOUR log — and excludes the stranger across the zone,
// whose kill pays you nothing and prints nothing.
//
// So the join runs here too, with progression.ts's exact semantics (claim BACKWARD inside
// KILL_EXP_JOIN_MS; a claim CONSUMES the line so it can never credit two kills; every death line
// consumes, including ones this module does not count). What it produces is one number per tier
// run, `credited`, that ONLY the celebration predicate reads. Nothing about tracking moved.
