// RESPAWN CLOCKS — the fold (JOS-194). Death lines in, live countdowns out.
//
// The vocabulary, the estimate ladder and the argument for all of it live in `shared/respawn.ts`;
// the wiki floor and the measurement of how thin it is live in `shared/respawnWiki.ts`. This file
// is the state machine between them and owns three things the pure code cannot:
//
//   1. THE ZONE STAY. A death→death gap is only a respawn sample when you never left the zone
//      between the two deaths, and only the fold knows where you have been. `zoneSince` is the
//      timestamp of the `You have entered` line that started the current stay; a gap qualifies
//      when the EARLIER death also falls inside it.
//      That same `zone` is ALSO what the display scopes to (owner ruling, 2026-08-10: the overlay
//      shows the zone you are in, the tab defaults to it). It is published as `RespawnSnap.zone`
//      and the surfaces filter against it with `respawnInZone` — deliberately ONE piece of zone
//      state serving both jobs, because a second tracker would be free to disagree with the one
//      that decides whether a gap counts. The ROWS are not filtered here: cross-zone data is kept
//      and published (bounded, most-recent-death first), so the tab's all-zones view and the
//      history behind it cost no second channel.
//   2. THE LRU. A months-long replay walks past thousands of distinct mob names and every one of
//      them is a potential watch candidate, so the history is capped and evicted by last-death.
//   3. ITS OWN REVISION NUMBER. This module has a SECOND INPUT — the user's watch list, edited
//      over IPC while the log sits idle — so reporting the last event's `seq` would let
//      `useModule`'s `d.seq <= knownSeq` dedupe silently swallow the push that carries a watch the
//      user just added. That is JOS-87's scar exactly (a combo correction written during an idle
//      log never reached the screen), so `rev` is a private counter bumped by anything that can
//      change the state, reported by BOTH `snapshot()` and `flushDelta()`, and the IPC setter
//      calls `registry.flushNow()` rather than waiting for the heartbeat. Both halves are needed.
//      By round 3 there are THREE such inputs — the watch list, a zone line, and a confirmed
//      sighting — and every one of them bumps `rev`. The rule generalizes: if it changes what the
//      screen shows, it moves the revision, or the delta is swallowed.
//      AND IT PUBLISHES EVERY WATCHED MOB IT HOLDS A DEATH FOR (round 8). This file used to sweep
//      the derived rows against a 30-minute linger, which meant a watch clicked hours after the
//      kill produced no row at all — the defect the owner reported from live play. The sweep is
//      gone; the linger's remaining jobs are readings in `shared/respawn.ts` and remove nothing.
//   4. WHAT THE LOG HAS SAID ABOUT A WATCHED MOB SINCE ITS CLOCK STARTED (round 3). The rulings
//      and the full coverage statement are in `shared/respawn.ts`; the mechanism here is small
//      and deliberately so — `seenNamesOf` maps a TYPED event to the names it states, `markSeen`
//      records the newest of them against the (zone, mob) entry, and nothing else in the fold
//      changes. In particular a sighting never touches `minGapMs`, `samples` or `lastTs`: it is
//      not a death and the ladder must not learn from it.
