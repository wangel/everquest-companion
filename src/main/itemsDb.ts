// itemsDb.ts — the COMMITTED wiki item database: its record shape, its ONE key function,
// and the pure index builder. Electron-free on purpose, so both `scripts/scrape-items.ts`
// (which WRITES the file) and `tests/itemsDb.test.mts` (which asserts on the committed
// bytes) can import the exact same definitions the app reads it with. Nothing here loads
// the JSON — `itemLookup.ts` owns that import, so a script or a test pays for the 8 MB
// only when it actually wants it.
//
// WHY A COMMITTED DATABASE AT ALL (owner decision, 2026-08-03: "we should be shipping the
// database with the bundle and committing it"). Item pages are static wiki content, and
// `itemLookup` was answering every unknown item with a two-request network round trip
// (search → parse) whose result then lived only in that one user's `userData` cache. So a
// fresh install answered nothing offline, every user re-scraped the same 11k items one at a
// time, and the wiki paid for all of it. Scraping the corpus ONCE and committing it is the
// precedent posky.json / quests.json / mobs.json already set, for the same reasons: instant,
// offline, identical for every user, and diffable against the wiki.
//
// SHAPE. A record is *literally* the `ItemKnowledge` fields `parseItemWikitext` produces —
// no projection, no renaming, so the lookup path needs no translation layer. Two
// concessions to bundle size (the JSON is ES-imported, so electron-vite INLINES it into
// every user's main bundle):
//   * false / empty fields are OMITTED rather than stored (`lore: false`, `questUses: []`
//     for ~11k records is pure weight). `knowledgeFromDb` restores the defaults.
//   * `name` is stored only when the page's `|itemname` DIFFERS from its title, which is
//     rare; otherwise the title IS the name.
// Both are restored in ONE place, `knowledgeFromDb`, so no caller ever sees the compact form.

import { itemBaseName } from '../shared/itemStats'

// has since changed is corrected at LOAD, never in the file. Read its header before adding a row.
