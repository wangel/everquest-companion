// toast.ts — main's half of the CELEBRATION TOAST (docs/plans/celebration-toasts.md).
//
// ONE HOP IN, ONE HOP OUT. The main window's always-mounted celebration detectors say what
// happened (`toast:show`, a ToastRequest); this module answers the one question only main can:
// WHAT DOES THE REWARD LOOK LIKE — `lookupItem` (cache-first, local posky before wiki) plus the
// pure `toastItemCard` formatter, so the overlay receives a finished card. The overlay bundle is
// MUI-free and fetches NOTHING (T5): if the item's knowledge is not in the payload, it is not on
// screen.
//
// A TOAST MAKES NO SOUND (owner, 2026-08-05: "remove the sound controls from preferences, they
// are already covered by Alerts module"). There used to be a second hop out — main read the
// toast's own `{packId, soundId}` + volume and asked the main window to play it. Both producers
// already fire a seeded ALERT with its own voice on the same event, so that path could only ever
// add a second voice over one kill. It is deleted rather than defaulted off: the toast's config
// no longer has a sound to read, and `toast:sound` is gone with it.
//
// LIVE-ONLY DISCIPLINE IS THE DETECTORS' (T4/celebrations law). There is deliberately NO gate
// here: `useBossKills` and `useProgress` already own "a LIVE transition, never hydration", and a
// second predicate in this file could only ever disagree with them.
//
// A CLOSED TOAST OVERLAY IS SILENT. Nothing is rendered and nothing is played when the window
// is not open — the sound belongs to the toast, not to the event (the event already has its own
// alert). That also makes the Preferences switch honest: off means off, everywhere.
