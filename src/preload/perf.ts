// preload/perf.ts — the performance-HUD half of the app bridge (docs/plans/perf-profiling.md).
//
// Spread into `api` in index.ts rather than written there, because that file is at the repo's
// 400-code-line factoring ceiling and the answer to that is a split, not a widened threshold.
// It is the same one-module-per-domain shape main's `ipc/` uses, and it changes nothing about
// the surface: `window.eq.getPerfPrefs()` and friends sit exactly where they always would.
//
// NOTHING HERE COSTS ANYTHING WHILE THE HUD IS OFF. Main creates no timer until the switch is
// on, so `onPerfSample` subscribes to a channel that is genuinely silent — which is why the
// title-bar chip may subscribe unconditionally.
